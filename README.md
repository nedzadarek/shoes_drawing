### About:

When learning to draw (a face or a kanji?) you can watch videos.  
This project aims to store each sequence of strokes too the file and later play it to user.  

### Installing/running:

1. Install [shoes](http://shoesrb.com/downloads.html)
2. Run it via:
 * command: `shoes image_set.rb`
 * open shoes -> Open an App. -> Choice the file.
 

### How to:

There is red background & text above that tells you where you can draw.
Click and move to draw.

### To fix

Draws lines closer to bottom edge than it should.
